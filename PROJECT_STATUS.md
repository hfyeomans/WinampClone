# WinAmp Clone Project Status

## Last Updated: 2025-07-27

## Completed Sprints

### Sprint 1: Audio Foundation ✅
- Core audio engine with AVAudioEngine
- File format support (MP3, M4A, WAV, FLAC, OGG)
- Playlist management system
- Basic playback controls

### Sprint 2: Classic UI ✅
- Main player window with classic WinAmp styling
- Transport controls (play, pause, stop, prev, next)
- Time display and seek functionality
- Volume and balance controls

### Sprint 5: Equalizer & Library ✅
- 10-band graphical equalizer
- Preset management system
- Media library with metadata scanning
- Library organization and search

### Sprint 6-7: Classic Skin Support ✅
- WSZ/ZIP skin file parsing
- Sprite extraction and rendering
- Region.txt parsing for click regions
- Pledit.txt parsing for playlist colors
- Viscolor.txt parsing for visualization colors
- Skin manager with hot-swapping support

### Sprint 8: Plugin System ✅
- Plugin architecture supporting three types:
  - Visualization plugins (spectrum, waveform, etc.)
  - DSP plugins (reverb, echo, compressor, etc.)
  - General purpose plugins (Discord presence, etc.)
- Plugin manager with dynamic loading
- Plugin preferences window
- Example plugins implemented

### Sprint 8-9: Procedural Skin Generation ✅
- HCT color space implementation
- TOML configuration parser with 5 default templates
- Palette generator with color theory algorithms
- Texture engine with 9 procedural texture types
- Component renderer for all UI elements
- Skin packager (.wsz file generation)
- Generation UI with live preview
- Batch generation capabilities

## Outstanding Issues

### Compilation Errors (from Sprint 8-9)
1. **Protocol Conflicts**:
   - `EnhancedVisualizationPlugin` has conflicting `metadata` properties from both `WAPlugin` and `VisualizationPlugin` protocols
   - Need architectural decision on protocol design

2. **Type Conversions**:
   - Plugin type arrays need proper casting in PluginPreferencesWindow
   - Some visualization plugins don't properly conform to base protocols

3. **Missing Imports**:
   - Several files still missing SwiftUI/AppKit imports
   - Some Combine imports missing for state management

4. **Access Modifiers**:
   - Various classes and properties need public access modifiers
   - Some protocol requirements not properly exposed

### Known Bugs
- FFTProcessor had duplicate declarations (partially fixed)
- ButtonStyle protocol issues in TransportControls (workaround applied)
- Plugin state equatable conformance (fixed but needs testing)

## Remaining Sprints

### Advanced Audio Features (Not Started)
- Gapless playback
- Crossfading between tracks
- Advanced DSP effects
- ReplayGain support
- Audio format conversion
- CD ripping capabilities

### Network Features (Not Started)
- Internet radio streaming
- Podcast support
- Online music service integration
- Skin downloading from repository
- Plugin marketplace
- Social features (sharing playlists, etc.)

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Compilation Errors**: Address the remaining compilation errors from Sprint 8-9
2. **Run Test Suite**: Execute the comprehensive test plan for skin generation
3. **Choose Next Sprint**: Decide between Advanced Audio Features or Network Features
4. **Architecture Review**: Consider refactoring plugin protocols to resolve conflicts

## Testing Status

- Sprint 8-9 has a comprehensive test plan in `SPRINT_8-9_TEST_PLAN.md`
- Previous sprints have basic unit tests but could use more coverage
- Integration tests needed for plugin system
- UI tests needed for skin generation interface

## Technical Debt

1. Plugin protocol design needs review to avoid metadata conflicts
2. Some error handling could be more robust
3. Performance optimization needed for large libraries
4. Memory management review for plugin lifecycle
5. Consider migrating from deprecated APIs (e.g., allowedFileTypes)
