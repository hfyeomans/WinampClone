# Window Resizing Issue Analysis & Solutions

## Issues Found

### 1. Window Resizing Not Working
**Problem**: Windows were not resizable by dragging corners despite setting `.windowResizability(.contentMinSize)`

**Root Cause**: In `MainPlayerView.swift`, the `WinAmpWindowConfiguration` was explicitly setting `resizable: false`, which caused the `WinAmpWindow` implementation to remove the `.resizable` style mask from the NSWindow.

**Solution**: Changed `resizable: false` to `resizable: true` in the configuration and adjusted the max size to allow for 2x scaling.

### 2. Skin Generator Not Working
**Problem**: The skin generator was failing due to incorrect enum values in `PrebuiltSkins.swift`

**Root Causes**:
- Using non-existent enum values like `.classic` instead of `.retro` for `VisualStyle`
- Using `.scanlines` instead of `.lines` for `TextureType`
- Using `.futuristic` and `.minimal` for button styles that don't exist
- Passing `nil` for textures instead of an empty `SkinGenerationConfig.Textures()`

**Solution**: Updated all enum values to match the actual definitions in `SkinGenerationTypes.swift`

### 3. App Bundle Not Updating
**Problem**: Changes weren't taking effect because the app was running from an old bundle

**Root Cause**: The app bundle at `WinAmpPlayer.app` was outdated (16:54) while the build output was newer (16:16). The user was running the old version.

**Solution**: 
1. Kill the running app process
2. Copy the fresh build from `.build/arm64-apple-macosx/release/WinAmpPlayer` to the app bundle
3. Relaunch the app

## Technical Details

### Window Resizing in SwiftUI/macOS

The window resizing system involves multiple layers:

1. **SwiftUI Scene Modifiers**: `.windowResizability(.contentMinSize)` tells SwiftUI how to handle resizing
2. **Window Configuration**: The `WinAmpWindowConfiguration` struct controls per-window settings
3. **NSWindow Style Masks**: The actual AppKit window needs the `.resizable` style mask

The issue was that even though the Scene had `.windowResizability(.contentMinSize)`, the custom window implementation was explicitly removing the `.resizable` style mask when `configuration.resizable` was false.

### Proper Build & Deployment Process

For macOS apps with custom window styling:

1. Build with Swift Package Manager: `swift build --configuration release`
2. Create/update app bundle structure:
   ```
   WinAmpPlayer.app/
   ├── Contents/
   │   ├── Info.plist
   │   ├── MacOS/
   │   │   └── WinAmpPlayer (executable)
   │   └── Resources/
   ```
3. Copy the built executable to the bundle
4. Ensure executable permissions are set
5. Kill any running instances before launching the new version

## Recommendations

1. **Build Script**: Create a build script that automates the app bundle creation and update process
2. **Window Resizing**: Consider making all windows resizable by default with appropriate min/max constraints
3. **Enum Validation**: Add compile-time checks or tests to ensure template configurations use valid enum values
4. **Hot Reload**: Consider implementing a development mode that watches for changes and automatically rebuilds

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Window can be resized by dragging corners
- [x] Window respects min/max size constraints
- [x] Skin generator opens without errors
- [x] Prebuilt skins are generated on first launch
- [x] App bundle contains the latest build
