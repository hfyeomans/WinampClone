## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Swift (UI) + Rust (skin generator) + Objective-C (bridging)
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI with AppKit for advanced features
- **Audio Library**: AVFoundation / Core Audio for native macOS audio
- **Build System**: Swift Package Manager + Xcode
- **Database**: SQLite for media library (planned)
- **Testing**: XCTest + Swift Testing framework

### Key Design Principles
- Faithful recreation of classic WinAmp aesthetics
- Modular architecture for skin support
- Plugin system for visualizations
- Performance-optimized audio processing
- Native macOS integration (Touch Bar, media keys, etc.)
- Modern Swift concurrency patterns
- MVVM architecture pattern for UI

### Technical Decisions Made
- [2025-01-28] Chose Swift Package Manager over CocoaPods/Carthage for dependency management
- [2025-01-28] Selected AVFoundation as primary audio framework for format support
- [2025-01-28] Decided on SwiftUI for modern declarative UI development
- [2025-01-28] Structured project with clear separation of Core and UI layers
- [2025-01-28] Implemented modular audio architecture with separate components for session, queue, and volume management
- [2025-01-28] Used logarithmic scaling for volume control to match human hearing perception
- [2025-01-28] Adopted protocol-oriented design for testability (e.g., AVAudioPlayerProtocol)
- [2025-01-28] Implemented comprehensive error handling with custom AudioEngineError enum
- [2025-01-28] Used KVO for reactive player status monitoring
