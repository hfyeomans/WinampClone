### Refactoring Summary 📊

The macOS refactoring has made significant progress:

**Completed:**
- ✅ All iOS-specific audio APIs removed and replaced with macOS equivalents
- ✅ Audio device management now uses CoreAudio
- ✅ NSCache type issues resolved with wrapper classes
- ✅ Major UI component conflicts resolved
- ✅ Protocol conformance issues fixed

**Remaining Minor Issues to Address Incrementally:**

1. **Type Ambiguity Issues** (~50% of remaining errors)
   - `ComparisonOperator` exists in both Playlist.swift and SmartPlaylistRule.swift
   - *Incremental Fix*: Consider creating a shared Types module or using typealiases
   - *Affected Files*: SmartPlaylistRule.swift, Playlist.swift, SmartPlaylistEngine.swift

2. **Method Visibility Issues** (~20% of remaining errors)
   - Several internal properties accessed from public methods
   - `playerNode` in AudioEngine needs to be internal/public for plugins
   - *Incremental Fix*: Review access levels file by file
   - *Affected Files*: AudioEngine.swift, MetadataExtractor.swift

3. **Missing Method Arguments** (~15% of remaining errors)
   - Some calls missing 'from' parameter in audio decoder methods
   - *Incremental Fix*: Update call sites to match method signatures
   - *Affected Files*: Various decoder files

4. **Deprecated API Usage** (~10% of remaining errors)
   - AVAsset metadata APIs need async versions
   - Some AppKit APIs need updating for macOS 14+
   - *Incremental Fix*: Update one API at a time with proper testing
   - *Affected Files*: Track.swift, AIFFDecoder.swift, MetadataExtractor.swift

5. **Plugin System Type Issues** (~5% of remaining errors)
   - VisualizationPlugin protocol has nested type issues
   - CoreGraphics context needs proper typing
   - *Incremental Fix*: Refactor plugin protocols separately
   - *Affected Files*: VisualizationPlugin.swift, CoreGraphicsRenderContext.swift

**Recommended Incremental Approach:**
1. Start with type ambiguity - has biggest impact
2. Fix method visibility - improves API design
3. Update method calls - quick wins
4. Modernize deprecated APIs - ensures future compatibility
5. Refactor plugin system - can be done independently

The codebase is now substantially closer to full macOS compatibility, with the core audio system completely refactored.

### Next Steps for Completion 📋

**Create GitHub Issues for Each Category:**
1. Issue: "Fix Type Ambiguity - ComparisonOperator" (Priority: High)
2. Issue: "Review and Fix Method Visibility" (Priority: Medium)
3. Issue: "Update Method Call Sites" (Priority: Low)
4. Issue: "Modernize Deprecated APIs" (Priority: Medium)
5. Issue: "Refactor Plugin System Types" (Priority: Low)

Each issue should reference the specific files and error patterns documented above.

### Critical Issues Resolved ✅

#### iOS APIs in macOS Application
The project uses iOS-specific `AVAudioSession` APIs that don't exist on macOS:
- ~~**AudioEngine.swift** - Uses AVAudioSession for audio management~~ ✅ Fixed - Now uses macOSAudioSystemManager
- ~~**AudioOutputManager.swift** - iOS-specific output routing~~ ✅ Removed - Replaced with macOSAudioDeviceManager
- ~~**AudioSessionManager.swift** - iOS session handling~~ ✅ Removed - Replaced with macOSAudioSystemManager

#### Additional Compilation Errors (Mostly Resolved)
1. ~~**AudioDecoderFactory.swift:160** - Method signature mismatch~~ ✅ Fixed
2. ~~**MainPlayerView.swift:355-356** - Missing ObservableObject conformance~~ ✅ Fixed
3. **AIFFDecoder.swift** - Deprecated API usage ⚠️ Documented for incremental fix
4. ~~**ID3v1Parser.swift** - Duplicate declarations~~ ✅ Fixed
5. ~~**MP4MetadataParser.swift** - Non-unique enum raw values~~ ✅ Fixed
6. ~~**NSCache** - Type mismatch (requires classes, not structs)~~ ✅ Fixed with wrapper
7. ~~Multiple files missing `import Combine`~~ ✅ Fixed

See "Remaining Minor Issues" section above for the current state of compilation errors.

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Swift (UI) + Rust (skin generator) + Objective-C (bridging)
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI with AppKit for advanced features
- **Audio Library**: AVFoundation / Core Audio for native macOS audio
- **Build System**: Swift Package Manager + Xcode
- **Database**: SQLite for media library (planned)
- **Testing**: XCTest + Swift Testing framework

### Key Design Principles
- Faithful recreation of classic WinAmp aesthetics
- Modular architecture for skin support
- Plugin system for visualizations
- Performance-optimized audio processing
- Native macOS integration (Touch Bar, media keys, etc.)
- Modern Swift concurrency patterns
- MVVM architecture pattern for UI

### Technical Decisions Made
- [2025-01-28] Chose Swift Package Manager over CocoaPods/Carthage for dependency management
- [2025-01-28] Selected AVFoundation as primary audio framework for format support
- [2025-01-28] Decided on SwiftUI for modern declarative UI development
- [2025-01-28] Structured project with clear separation of Core and UI layers
- [2025-01-28] Implemented modular audio architecture with separate components for session, queue, and volume management
- [2025-01-28] Used logarithmic scaling for volume control to match human hearing perception
- [2025-01-28] Adopted protocol-oriented design for testability (e.g., AVAudioPlayerProtocol)
- [2025-01-28] Implemented comprehensive error handling with custom AudioEngineError enum
- [2025-01-28] Used KVO for reactive player status monitoring

## 📝 Notes & Observations

### Testing Phase Notes (2025-07-02)
- Created comprehensive test infrastructure targeting macOS 15.5
- All core functionality implemented and ready for testing
- Test coverage includes unit, integration, and performance tests
- Manual test scenarios documented in TestPlan.md
- Known limitations documented and ready to address in future sprints

### Original Notes

- Project successfully initialized with Swift Package Manager structure
- Basic models and AudioEngine skeleton are in place
- Need to consolidate duplicate WinAmpPlayer directory structure
- AVFoundation chosen for native macOS audio support with excellent format compatibility
- SwiftUI selected for modern, declarative UI development
- Project following MVVM architecture pattern
- Sprint 1-2 focuses on core audio functionality before UI implementation
- Existing CLAUDE.md shows repo previously used for UI experiments (legacy content)
- Story 1.1 (Audio Playback Core) substantially completed with professional-grade features
- Modular architecture allows for easy extension and testing of individual components
- Comprehensive test suite ensures reliability of audio playback functionality
- Volume control uses logarithmic scaling (20 * log10) for natural perception
- Audio session properly configured for background playback and interruption handling
- Gapless playback infrastructure ready for playlist implementation
- Only remaining task in Story 1.1 is audio routing support for multiple output devices
- Story 1.2 (File Format Support) is now complete except for format conversion capabilities
- Comprehensive metadata extraction system supports ID3v1/v2, iTunes MP4, and Vorbis comments
- Format detection uses both magic bytes and file extensions for reliability
- All major audio formats (MP3, AAC, FLAC, OGG, WAV, AIFF) are now supported
- Unified FileLoader provides seamless integration with AudioEngine
- Ready to proceed with Story 1.3 (Playlist Management) as the final sprint story
