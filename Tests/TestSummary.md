## Known Issues and Workarounds

### Current Limitations
1. **High DPI Displays:** Some visualizations may need optimization for 5K/6K displays
   - *Workaround:* Use standard visualization modes on high-resolution displays

2. **Network Streams:** Limited support for certain streaming protocols
   - *Workaround:* Download files locally for guaranteed playback

3. **Large Playlists:** Performance may degrade with >10,000 items
   - *Workaround:* Split into smaller playlists

### Platform-Specific Notes
- **Apple Silicon:** Native performance, all features supported
- **Intel Macs:** Full compatibility, slightly higher CPU usage
- **macOS Ventura (14.x):** Compatible with minor UI adjustments
- **macOS Monterey (12.x):** Limited support, some features unavailable

## Test Artifacts

All test artifacts are available in the `test_results/` directory:
- **Test Logs:** Detailed execution logs with timestamps
- **Coverage Report:** Interactive HTML coverage visualization
- **Benchmark Results:** JSON format for trend analysis
- **Memory Analysis:** Leak detection and allocation reports
- **Performance Profiles:** CPU and GPU usage traces

## Continuous Integration

### Recommended CI Configuration
```yaml
test_matrix:
