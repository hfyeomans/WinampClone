## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **SecondaryWindowManager**: Centralized window lifecycle management

- **Consistent styling**: Extended WinAmpColors palette
- **Modular design**: Each window is self-contained

### Integration
- All windows accessible from main player clutterbar
- Windows properly register with WindowCommunicator
- Playlist controller integration for track management
- Audio engine integration for equalizer (structure ready)

## Files Added
1. `EqualizerWindow.swift` - 10-band EQ implementation
2. `LibraryWindow.swift` - Media library browser
3. `WinAmpColors+Playlist.swift` - Extended color palette
4. `PlaylistWindow.swift` - Playlist editor (from PR #24)
5. `Playlist+Sorting.swift` - Sorting functionality
6. `SecondaryWindows.swift` - Window management

## Known Limitations / Future Enhancements

### Equalizer
- Audio processing not connected to actual audio engine (UI complete)
- Custom preset save/load not implemented
- Auto-gain feature marked as TODO

### Library
- Folder scanning not implemented
- Database persistence not implemented
- Metadata extraction for library items pending

### Playlist
- Drag-and-drop reordering needs NSTableView integration
- Folder scanning not implemented
- URL input dialog not implemented

## Build Status
✅ **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** - All components compile without errors

## Testing
- Application launches successfully
- All three windows open correctly from main player
- UI renders properly with classic WinAmp styling
- Basic interactions work (buttons, sliders, selections)

## Sprint 5 Metrics
- **Stories Completed**: 3/3 (100%)
- **Files Created**: 6
- **Files Modified**: 3
- **Total Lines of Code**: ~2000
- **Build Status**: Success
- **Time to Complete**: Within sprint timeline
