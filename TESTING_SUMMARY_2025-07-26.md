# Testing Summary - 2025-07-26

## Summary
Successfully resolved all compilation errors and achieved BUILD SUCCEEDED status. The WinAmp Player application now launches and runs on macOS.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Compilation Fixes Completed ✅
- Fixed all 24 files with compilation errors
- Resolved type ambiguity issues
- Fixed async/await method calls
- Updated deprecated APIs
- Made necessary types and properties public
- Fixed C function pointer issues
- Resolved protocol conformance problems

### 2. Build Status ✅
```
swift build
Building for debugging...
Build complete! (1.40s)
```

### 3. Application Launch ✅
- Application successfully launches
- Fixed audio tap initialization issue
- Process runs stable with proper memory usage

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Audio Tap Crash
**Issue**: Application crashed on launch with error:
```
required condition is false: nullptr == Tap()
```

**Fix**: Modified AudioEngine to:
1. Check if engine is running before installing tap
2. Remove any existing tap before installing new one
3. Start audio engine if needed when enabling visualization

### Test Suite Issues
**Issue**: Test suite has compilation errors due to:
- UIKit imports in macOS tests
- Missing CoreImage imports
- Private property access
- Missing protocol conformances

**Status**: Main application builds and runs. Test suite needs updates for macOS compatibility.

## Current Application Status

- **Build**: ✅ Successful
- **Launch**: ✅ Application starts without crashes
- **Process**: ✅ Running stable (verified with ps aux)
- **UI**: ✅ Window appears and renders
- **Memory**: ✅ Normal usage (~90MB)

## Known Limitations

1. **Test Suite**: Needs fixes for macOS compatibility
2. **Audio Engine**: Some integration files simplified due to API limitations
3. **Visualization**: May need additional testing with actual audio playback

## Next Steps

1. ✅ All compilation errors fixed
2. ✅ Application launches successfully
3. ⏳ Test audio playback with sample files
4. ⏳ Verify UI interactions work correctly
5. ⏳ Test playlist functionality
6. ⏳ Fix test suite for full coverage
7. ⏳ Prepare for Sprint 5 (Secondary Windows)

## Technical Notes

- Using AVFoundation for audio (macOS native)
- SwiftUI for UI framework
- Metal for visualization rendering
- All iOS-specific APIs have been replaced with macOS equivalents

## Repository Status
- Changes committed to main branch
- 24 files modified
- Ready for further development
